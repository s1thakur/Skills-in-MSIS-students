Claim: MSIS students from SCU are recruited by top companies due to skills they have acquired in their courses.

The visualization contains two parts. 
One shows that SCU is offering the courses that are in demand on LinkedIn. It integrates those skills with the courses offered and with average salary earned in that skill. It is helpful for recruiters because in a sense it sets a minimum expectation from candidates and lets them know the range they should be willing to offer while hiring.
